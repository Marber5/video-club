# HTML Video

The HTML <video> tag is used to embed a media player which supports video playback into the HTML page. We use the HTML <video> tag and the <source> tag to show the video.

## Browser output

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Attributes

Let us look at the attributes supported by the HTML <video> tag.

    autoplay
    controls
    height and width
    loop
    muted
    src
    preload

### Installing

In the above code,

    video.mp4 - path to the video we want to display
    video/mp4 - the type of resource we want to display
    controls - allows user to control the video

The video.mp4 file in the above example is located in the same directory as the HTML file.

## Running the tests

In the above program, we have used the autoplay attribute. The video will start playing as soon as it is ready, without requiring the user to click the play button. 

### Deployment
The control attribute allows the user to control the video. These controls might include things like a play button, a pause button, and volume control. This can be helpful for allowing the user to control the playback of the video, without needing to use any additional software or tools.
